### Simulations source code
This repository contains the source code and output data for the simulation study presented in the paper Definition, Identification, and Estimation of the Direct and Indirect Number Needed to Treat by Valentin Vancak and Arvid Sjölander.

It includes:

1. Full simulation scripts for the double logit and double probit models
2. Estimated point estimators of the nine effect indices
3. Corresponding analytical confidence interval limits
4. Code for plotting and summarizing simulation results
